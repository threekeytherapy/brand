# Phase 2 - Discovery Questions

## Your business / brand overview

It's not quite a business yet - it's currently more an open participatory research into what it means to be human. I'm still really experimenting and learning, so it's a bit difficult to answer coherently.

## What are the reasons for creating this new brand? What are your goals?

I primarily just want to do more treatments, and I just want to get enough money to sustain further research and practice.

For this I would like a site that people who know me already can share with their network, that I can parachute into some whatsapp groups, put up on sites like hipsy.nl, some expat forums, perhaps go to HR offices at corporates/etc

www.thebodysessions.com is ok for now, but I don't feel very confident with it, and I don't quite feel it represents me or that I am proud of it

So to answer the question in a KPI way - I'd like to get to 6-8 clients a week that are willing to pay 60-90 euros a session, with a combination of working from home and from a studio

## Where are you now (mission) and where would you like to be (vision)?

**Three Key Therapy - Unlock your self with body-based therapy.**

Find the missing key to unlock yourself - untangle emotional knots, release physical blockages and … mental loops with body-based therapy.

(My name is Claus and I am a body-based therapist. My mission is to/I) help people find the key to unlock themselves - untangling emotional knots, releasing physical blockages and … mental loops.

Central inspiration and driving force is based on spiritual masters such as Jalaluddin Rumi, ‘Ibn Arabi, Buddha, and more contemporary like Gurdjieff, samyeling.org, chisholme.org

Convinced by the line that you can’t be a good priest without being a doctor and can’t be a good doctor without being a priest.

## Your desired business image

Complete, deep, well grounded

But also humble

I definitely realised I can't separate form from content. I get irked by form without content, or form that is taken from elsewhere to promote and market unconnected content. I am content first, and then form supports the delivery. 

You asked me about brands I like.

I realised I don't really like brands (and less so the large corporates behind big brands, and the capitalist dynamics behind large corporates). I particularly dislike brands that work to create a sense of inclusion through exclusion based on class division/exclusiveness/fanciness. And brands that create a nice fluffy image on the backs of products and services built on exploitation. 

I try buy clothing with the least amount of branding possible, mostly second hand shop. Brands so I like are very functional - thinkpad laptops for durability and user replaceability, organic food and biodegradable products, local and family run where possible, solid outdoor waterproof gear, open source and open data products where feasible, companies like Patagonia or Radical Open Security that put social/environmental value at the core of their statutes/governance/business model.... - there is no particular brand that captivates me with their visuals ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

If something is too polished on the outside I’m already sceptical because I feel the investment in the facade comes at a cost to the value/product/service. And I want quality products, feel ripped off if I’m paying for some silly expensive and empty coating.  For example - I like restaurants and bars that look dubious from the outside but radiate love in the kitchen. 

So if something is just “a brand” trying to sell something, I get suspicious. I think I really appreciate people practising radical self expression and companies radiating their intentions - because it’s clear and honest about what they want to change/contribute to the world.

I have met all these people/places and their website really matches their personality. It’s an extension of who they are.

## Your unique selling point

I’m in the middle of floaty hippie and tight corpo

10 years public sector software innovation

Serious, but open to the fluffy

Lots of multicultural experience 

Cast a very wide net in what/where I learn from

I can meet people on the level where they are at

Medical professional = cold

Hippy spiritual = not a lot of rational

I bring the best of both worlds.

Translating between the medical and spiritual.

Diverse viewpoint in the world from years of living and travelling around.

I meet people where they are.

Manuvision has 30 years of research and experience, is covered by Danish insurance, gets contracted by government agencies, have trained about 750-1000 therapists and my teachers have:

1) therapist for lars von trier/danish Olympic handball team/Contador and Sagal
2) European champion Karate (8th dan black belt or something like that)
3) done scientifically validated studies that prove body therapy was extremely helpful for soldiers with PTSD
4) work with ceo-level managers in Danish corporates about leadership

So this isn't just me making it up, the method is very serious and developed. After my exam in december I can call myself a manuvision therapist. I will have done about 1000 hours of classes spread over two years, +-600 hours of homework practice and +-500 hours of treatment experience.

## Value Proposition

I bring 2 year education and 10 years of personal practice
