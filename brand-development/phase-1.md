# Phase 1 - mission/purpose

I am driven by:

* If everything is transitory, and we are all going to die - what makes sense to focus on?
* If I can perceive my most intimate experiences (thoughts, feelings, sensations) and recognize these are transitory - where do I watch from? Is this still personal?
* My experience of reality feels so unique and personal, yet we all have a burning sense of “I-ness” and the experience of joy, suffering, emotions, change, time etc.. is universal. So what it mine?

So my mission is to help people untangle themselves from trivial preoccupations, hangups, blockages and take one step closer to realisation of what it means to be a human being alive right now. Which historically has been phrased as coming into the presence of God, buddha nature, etc

Body therapy is an incredible tool for this, as so much of our personality construct is generated by the constellation of physical tensions and sensations in our body. The latter is largely determined by what our nervous system holds on to. Body therapy allows the reset/refresh/defragmenting of clutter from the nervous system, to then give much more space and openness for being-in-the-moment. This radically opens up a space for joy, compassion, empathy and wisdom.

I may want to expand beyond body therapy in the future (lucid dreaming, constellation work, whatever comes up on the path towards the absolute).

I will be earning ½ of my current career, so it’s not for the money. It’s because I lost my father and saw my mum in a 5 month psychosis during covid, had a royal burn out and this is the path which makes most sense to me for now, as all the rest seems like a distraction.

### Your brand/company values

Humility, Dedicated effort and work, Empathy, Standing with the unknown, vulnerability

### Your target audience

1. People that are into spiritual seeking/recognising
2. People that are really struggling with physical/emotional problems 
3. In the future, for financial reasons, corporate managers whose trauma-reactions are hampering their growth as managers

### Your competitors

People that are allies/complementary, but people could choose instead of me:


1. More hippy bodywork practitioners (breathwork, microdose, somatic release, art therapy, movement & embodiment stuff)
2. Classical more ‘serious’ therapists (Gestalt, CBT, psychologists,..)

People that I want to be competing with:

1. Pharma industry prescribing people pills
2. The industrial-escapism-complex involving endless empty micro adrenaline/stress/dopamine fixes to the brain (instagram, netflix, coffee, alcohol, fast fashion, moar notifications, busy-busy-doing-but-I-don’t-know-why etc etc)
