# Visual identity

## Your visual taste

Not very visual (canâ€™t tell fonts apart, not very fashionable, designed ) 

Hippie earthy tones, (dark red (the chinese furniture/buddhist red), green, brown, orange)
natural leaves
wood textures
oxblood
mahogany
buddhist temple orange and red
Bark and trees. Particularly twisted branches and roots. Beech and birch

Anarchist (black/red), dark mode, squats with giant welded metal sculptures and abandoned infrastructure, atmospheric, industrial, spacious

Islamic geometry

Mathematical - the one and the many

Alchemy - simplicity of  the clean lines
Black and white
Geometric
Abstract

Art Noveau

High detail
Symbols

Tessellation

Buddha -  Chenrezig - multiple hands

## fonts

I think the fonts that most appeal to me are art deco things like:

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DZu-aoMg0x_el_5nO12c-Vw5C5oGI64S/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DZu-aoMg0x_el_5nO12c-Vw5C5oGI64S/view?usp=drivesdk)

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1thv9qHV3RtkkuReQIqvAZSDiPbAu_NSz/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1thv9qHV3RtkkuReQIqvAZSDiPbAu_NSz/view?usp=drivesdk) (though not super legible... ) 

And maybe in the logos  here [https://www.saxomania.com/](https://www.saxomania.com/) and here [https://aqua-azul.be/](https://aqua-azul.be/)

Bold, but still some squigglyness. Don't know if that fits the purpose, leave it up to you. 

(also noticing the common warm yellows/oranges in the above) 

Gopher
Marcellus
Mulish font
Bressay font 

## graphics

In terms of graphic, some variation of/on triquetra seems to fit somehow. It has the 3. It's a very old symbol, used in many contexts and purposes (so i don't feel it's a direct appropriation of something particular), usually with a spiritual meaning of sorts.

Also bold but somehow soft. Perhaps in the logo, or maybe a mark that can be used across several things.
