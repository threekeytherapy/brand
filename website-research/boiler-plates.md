# Boiler plates

## Intro

My name is Claus, I am a Manuvision body therapist, and I work to help you let go of emotional knots, cyclical thought patterns and chronic tensions by restoring a sense of trust and safety to your nervous system. 

Open up the space within by trusting you can let go of emotional knots, cyclical thought patterns and chronic tensions.

## About Manuvision

Manuvision is a community of body therapists building on 25 years of research in liberating the nervous system. 

We work by creating a space of trust and presence in which people can open up to vulnerability, be seen and heard, and feel supported to overcome their struggle.

Manuvision therapists have been proven to help soldiers with PTSD in clinical studies, work alongside world leading and Olympic athletes, and support senior political and corporate leaders in becoming better leaders. 

Manuvision draws from Chinese traditional medicine, Western physiotherapy, Jungian psychology and shadow work, breathwork, inner child work, as well as various other traditions. 
 
## About Me

My name is Claus, I have a Belgian passport, grew up in Asia, and speak English, Dutch, Spanish and French.

Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by different perspectives on reality, and spent the last 10 years facilitating international collaborations on (open source) software projects for governments.

After receiving a massive wave of grief, loss and a nervous breakdown, I decided to shift my focus to what matters most - being alive in the previous time that is left. After dabbling with the existential arts since I was 16, and working within the Manuvision system since 2016, I completed a 2 year intensive training to become a Manuvision therapist.

I am deeply inspired by Sufi and Buddhist traditions, lucid dreaming, shadow work, and open to knowledge of self in whatever form it comes. 

## How does it work?

The nervous system is our central communication channel. It helps us navigate the physical and social world we live in.

It works to keep us safe by remembering what felt safe, what felt as a threat - that time my boundaries were not respected, I was praised or punished for being loud/quiet, dominant/submissive, openly sad/joyful/angry.

As such, it also shapes our personality and body construct - when we tense, when we relax, how secure we feel in interpersonal relations, what role we take in a group dynamic, and and most importantly when and where we allow ourselves to let go and express core emotions of anger, sadness, joy and fear. 

And the things that really hurt - well, they stick. Old fears, pains and angers create a constant strain on the nervous system, the body and the sense of freedom to be yourself. A constant tension in the stomach, a constant worry about how others perceive me, and a sense of being trapped and constrained. 

Surfacing, acknowledging and letting go of these old experiences and blockages frees the nervous system, the body, and you! :) 

One step towards a more happy, peaceful and free life.
