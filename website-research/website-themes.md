# Website themes

## My priorities

### What do I need from a website?

Warm and trustful - not cold, corporate and straight. Quirky, warm, comforting.

Menu - enjoyable both desktop and mobile  
Colours - not nightmare to change  
Darkmode - turn off or be able to control how it looks  
Pictures - at least 3-4 that look nice, full bleed and circled ideally  
Homepage offerings - title and link, picture optional  
FAQ - collapsable boxes  
Testimonials - coloumn that renders nicely on desktop and mobile  
Form - book free inquiry   
Resources - collection (of post) function would be nice as it allows for an image to each. Otherwise simply markdown lists and pages.

### Decisions 

It will be jekyll - to learn how it works and allow me to write blogposts and resources (which I really want to do) 
I would like it to be public repo, but not 100% essential I guess

Multiple pages (current preference as nicer for mobile and less clutter)
Single pag + resources

## Chosing a theme

Current ranking:
1) Personal (unknown)  
2) Serif (last year)  
?) Forty jekyll  
?) Solid State jekyll 
?) Spectral jekyll  
  
?) Creative (5 years old)  
?) Agency (7 years old)  
?) dimensions, cool, but font super small - not responsive enough  

Themes that are nice but can't go to public repo:
* Advance, snowlake - confimred
* Argon and Personal - not sure

### Personal

Menu and nav - great   
Colours - test  
Pictures - Great  
Homepage offerings - great   
FAQ - test  
Testimonials - unclear  
Form - there  
Resources - can use the services collection?  

Sense: it needs nice images - but could be cool!! 

### Jekyll Serif 

Menu and nav - great   
Colours - test  
Pictures - test  
Homepage offerings - services collection or if with pictures - hack on featured staff function? (need to hack function twice)  
FAQ - test  
Testimonials - hack on unfeatured staff page? (but needs to be displayed on mobile! now doesn't)  
Form - there  
Resources - can use the services collection?  

Sense: great place to start, but font is a bit small

--> Can I make "page with testimonials" layout --> how many files define the staff page?  
--> Can I make "services with picture collection" layout for homepage from the staff page?  
---> Can I move "services without picture" to resources page?  

### Solid State

--> check colours, check content structure

Check jekyll version to see if can escape posts, colours scheme is easy to change, and if can break from posts

### Forty 

--> test pictures, test colour changes

Check Jekyll version to see if the colour overlay on boxes can be changed, can escape posts, how to general thing is structured 

### Spectral

--> colours easier to change than solid state? trade off for square pictures instead of rounded?

## Long list of jekyll themes

### Directories

https://jekyllthemes.io

### Top picks

Personal - beautiful navigation and feel, but limited in the layouts and features 
https://personal.jekyllthemes.io/

Argon lots of layouts and features, but slightly clunky navigation?
https://argon.jekyllthemes.io/

Advance nice simple big pics, great menu, alternative to Argon
https://jekyll-advance.netlify.app/
https://www.zerostatic.io/theme/jekyll-advance/

### Discarded

Also not bad (but tortoiz - so no github public)  
https://miles-jekyll.tortoizthemes.com/index7   - flashy (nice templates, but argon same same?)  
https://livvic-jekyll.tortoizthemes.com/#portfolio - nice single page paralax (but menu doesn't float down)  

Nice free one to play around with
