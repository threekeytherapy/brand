## Typical request 

Hi Claus, I received your number from my friend.

I have also visited your website and am eager to book an individual session with you. I have gone through quite some events in my life, and next to talking therapy, I have been very interested in bodywork as I notice that I still have a tough time dealing with anxiety and other past traumas.

Please let me know how I can book a session with you?

## Example clients

## Person 1

Person came to me curious to try. Didn’t say why.

Turns out they had 30h labour, c-section, felt very afraid during, was surrounded by 10-15 people in masks, tubes everywhere, no one who took her fear seriously and gave her any human comfort.

They had been struggling for 1.5 years with 0 sexual desire, constant burping whenever they relaxed a bit, general feeling of overwhelm, not being seen. Had done all kinds of tests, physio, medication, gastro specialist, therapy, etc without any results.

We worked weekly for 8 weeks to relax the tension and holding around the c section scar -> burping reduced (tension reduction -> intestines more able to move -> less problems) and sexual desire returned (abdomen physically relaxed, mental trauma around birth and sexuality also relaxed) and the person felt much more seen/recognized that while it was a medically “totally fine, 0 risk procedure”, it was a traumatic experience that needed to be recognised and worked through. Still ongoing work.

## Person 2

Came to try it out because “they were struggling with some shit”, didn’t share, I didn’t ask.

One session was very helpful for them. She was estranged with her father after her parents divorce. Her father passed away and included them in their will. The father’s new partner/kids/family etc were extremely angry and hateful towards her, which had been causing her deep feelings of anguish, guilt, uneasiness, and thinking about what to do, how to make it up.

The session gave her the space to connect to some of the pain, grief and anger, allowing her to realise that it’s their problem, not hers, and finding more peace with herself that she didn’t do anything wrong. 


## Person 3

Person came to me because “there was something with their legs”. They kept gaining weight around their legs no matter what they did, their knees hurt, and had been doing 2 years of talk therapy but felt stuck.

We worked together for about 10 sessions every other week, doing general work but also really focusing on the hips/upper legs. She realised she doesn’t feel her legs most of the time, so we worked to bring awareness back down to the legs. Culminated with 2 cathartic sessions in which we were kind of play fighting and she allowed her legs to really kick back and struggle. Brought a cathartic moments of tears, she said it was really important but didn’t want to share the details (for me there were clear signs of abuse/violence/struggle - kicks that weren’t given in the moment and pent up rage/fear/sadness). Let me know this suddenly allowed her to sleep so much better than she had in years. Never came back, sent some friends.

Less detailed list of example issues

People often start with curiosity or one thing, and it usually goes to something else, ranging through:
-> parents divorce when young, anger/grief that was never given a place because they clamped on/took responsibility for a parent
-> being with a younger partner, waiting for them to make up their mind about kids, now no longer able to get pregnant, processing grief and anger at situation and partner
-> burn out/stress/anxiety/super tired all the time
-> multiple sclerosis 
-> general maintenance 
-> depression
-> family members that are going through cancer/psychosis/… and struggling to cope
