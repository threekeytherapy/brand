## Initial considerations

It is NOT:

* A massage
* relaxing

It is:

* Serious
* Therapeutic 
* Can be difficult and painful and confronting

Who is the audience:

* People for who talk therapy isnâ€™t working
* Want to explore deeper
* Have long term physical issues
* Burnout and stress

What does the audience want:

* They are stuck, frustrated, depressed, anxious, etc -> feel like they are carrying a unique pain
* They want to explore
* Have this long standing body thing they want to get rid of
* A friend told them to try this

Markets:

* Main: referrals from existing clients/people I meet
* Secondary: People who google therapy, body therapy, body work, somatic
* Secondary: People who find fliers 

People should feel:

* Confidence 
* Trust
* That the body is at the centre of what I do 
* Non-judgemental, welcoming
* Serious 

What I am about:

* Self-discovery 
* Self awareness and realisation
* Taking responsibility and confronting shadows 

Requirements:

* Easy to turn into a visual image? Would be good to have for fliers
* .com domain? Not so important
* Self explanatory title? Good to have
* Contains something easy to remember and unique for google search? Good to have 
* Something people can add on to explain/catch phrase to make it more memorable? Good to have

Existing search terms:

* Body work, embodiment
* somatic
* Body holds the score
* Ilan Lev, Avi Grunberg, 

Possible forms:

* One word + body therapy
* Two words + therapy 
* Name + body therapy as subtitle

Words I like:

* Mirror

* Root
* Veil
* Key
* Three/triple
* Shadow
* Unlock
* Open
